# D0018D-Object-oriented-programming-in-Java
In the course, you will learn object-oriented programming in Java, which means that you will handle classes, objects, abstract classes and dynamic binding, among other things. Furthermore, you will design graphical user interfaces as well as saving on and reading from different types of files.


Prerequisites
General entry requirements and the course require basic knowledge of programming (Java or another programming language) equivalent to Introductory Programming in Java, 7.5 credits (D0017D).


SYLLABUS


Objectives/Expected study results
After passing the course, the student should be able to demonstrate knowledge and understanding as well as practical skills in independently constructing a well-structured program with graphical user interface and file management in the programming language Java according to object-oriented principles based on a problem description. 


Course Contents
Object-oriented programming involves, among other things, the management of classes and objects. Furthermore, the course includes the construction of graphical user interfaces as well as different types of file management. The course covers the parts: -classes and objects -methods -inheritance -abstract classes and interface -graphical user interfaces (GUI) -applets -file management -introduction to database connection -separation of GUI and logic -introduction to UML (Unified Modelling Language)
